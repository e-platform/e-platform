/**
 * A simple replacement for the java.util.Timer class in JDK 1.3.
 * <P>
 * Functionally this class performs similarly to the java.util.Timer
 * class in JDK 1.3 although it probably is not as robust. The main
 * difference is that it uses a simple List for its task queue that
 * it traverses linearly, so it may not scale as well as the 1.3
 * version.
 * <P>
 * Refer to the JDK 1.3 documentation for a full description of how
 * this works.
